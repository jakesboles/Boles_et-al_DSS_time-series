#This script calculates consensus module eigengenes and plots them for all consensus modules in one large figure
#This figure was used to categorize modules according to their regulation during/after DSS 
#Ultimately, this was used to correlate brain gene signatures with colon gene signatures that we've defined temporally 
#This script will also generate a large file with gene-level information, including module membership stats and correlation information with traits from traits.csv
